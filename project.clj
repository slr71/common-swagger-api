  ;; Records versions Leiningen already resolves, read off the resolved
  ;; classpath rather than copied from lein's "Consider using these
  ;; :managed-dependencies" hint -- that hint names the version that LOST the
  ;; conflict, so pasting it would be a silent upgrade. Most of these arbitrate
  ;; metosin/compojure-api 1.1.14, the final release of an archived project whose
  ;; transitives disagree with each other, and clj-http vs buddy-core.  ;;
  ;; The jackson-* entries align a family that the cheshire 6 upgrade split
  ;; (core/cbor/smile at 2.21.1, databind/annotations left at 2.18.3). Jackson
  ;; needs those to move together; :pedantic? cannot see it because each artifact
  ;; is individually unambiguous, only the family has drifted apart.
