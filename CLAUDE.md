# Package with all dependencies
lein uberjar

# Deploy to Clojars repository
lein deploy
```

### Testing and Linting

lein test

# Run specific test namespace
lein test namespace.name

# Lint with Eastwood
lein eastwood

# Lint with clj-kondo
lein clj-kondo

# Check for outdated dependencies
lein ancient
```

### Development
```bash

# Clean build artifacts
lein clean

# Check syntax and warn on reflection
lein check
```

## Architecture

This is a Clojure library providing common dependencies, functions, and schema definitions for CyVerse services using metosin/compojure-api for Swagger-documented REST endpoints.

### Core Components

1. **Schema Definitions** (`src/common_swagger_api/schema/`)
   - Provides Schema-based type definitions for API endpoints
   - Organized by domain: apps, data, metadata, tools, analyses, etc.
   - Each domain has sub-modules for specific functionality

2. **Malli Integration** (`src/common_swagger_api/malli.clj`)
   - New Malli-based schema definitions (currently being introduced)
   - Provides `StatusResponse` schema and basic validators like `NonBlankString`

3. **Route Utilities** (`src/common_swagger_api/routes.clj`)
   - Custom Compojure API metadata handlers
   - Provides `:description-file` and `:deprecated` parameter restructuring
   - Helper for generating delegation blocks in API documentation

4. **Coercion** (`src/common_swagger_api/coerce.clj`)
   - Custom coercion utilities for API parameters

### Schema Organization

The schema definitions follow a hierarchical structure:
- Top-level schemas in `schema.clj` provide base functionality and imports from compojure-api
- Domain-specific schemas are organized in subdirectories
- Admin-specific schemas are nested under their respective domains (e.g., `apps/admin/`)

### Important Notes

- This is a library project with no application entry point
- Currently uses both Schema (primary) and Malli (being introduced) for validation
- Deployed to Clojars for use by other CyVerse services
- Jenkins CI/CD pipeline handles testing and deployment via Docker

## Code Style Guidelines

### General Formatting
- Keep line lengths to 120 characters or less when possible
- Ensure each file ends with a newline

## Schema Migration Guidelines

When migrating schemas from `plumatic/schema` to `metosin/malli`:

1. **Namespace Mirroring** - Migrated schemas should maintain parallel namespace structure
   - Example: `common-swagger-api.schema.apps` â†’ `common-swagger-api.malli.apps`

2. **Code Formatting**
   - Keep line lengths to 120 characters or fewer when possible
   - When splitting strings across multiple lines, use `str` to concatenate them

3. **Field Definition Reuse**
   - When translating map fields, reuse definitions wherever an identical or similar field exists elsewhere
   - For similar but not identical fields, use functions in `malli.util` to enable reuse while preserving differences
   - When a field is defined outside of a map (for example, in `common-swagger-api.schema.apps.rating/UserRatingParam`),
     It's useful to generate a function in the Malli translation so that the field name can be specified as a parameter
     when the field is used in a map.
   - When a function is defined for a field, use that function in the same places the corresponding variable was used 
     in the original schema
   - Use `malli.util/merge` when combining schemas where the original used `merge`

4. **Schema Definition Order** - The order of schema definitions should be the same in `schema` and `malli` namespaces
   - This is done to make it easier to tell which schemas still need to be migrated.
